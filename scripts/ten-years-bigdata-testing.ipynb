    "## Mantivemos exatamente essas listas de palavras-chave por três motivos principais:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cobertura dos Frameworks e Métodos Mais Citados\n",
    "– As ferramentas em TEST_TOOLS (JUnit, Selenium, TestNG, etc.) e os métodos em TEST_METHODS (TDD, BDD, Exploratory Testing etc.) são, segundo nossa revisão de literatura e inspeções iniciais de posts, os que aparecem com muito mais frequência em discussões de engenharia de testes — incluindo aquelas voltadas a Big Data.\n",
    "– Elas formam um “conjunto semente” que garante que, ao menos, os casos de uso mais estabelecidos (unitários, integração, aceitação, carga, etc.) sejam capturados de imediato.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base para Descoberta de Novos Termos via Clusterização\n",
    "– Mantendo essas palavras como anchors, podemos depois extrair todo o texto dos posts e aplicar técnicas de embedding + clustering.\n",
    "– Os clusters que contiverem termos próximos a “JUnit”, “Selenium” ou a expressões como “Test-Driven Development” indicarão grupos semânticos onde novos nomes de ferramentas/métodos podem emergir.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistência com Estudos Pré-existentes\n",
    "– Elas são amplamente reconhecidas em artigos de validação de qualidade e testes de Big Data (por exemplo, Gao et al. 2016 e Arshad et al. 2021 destacam frameworks como JUnit ou métodos exploratórios).\n",
    "– Ao começar com um vocabulário consensual, reduzimos o ruído de termos irrelevantes e focamos nossa análise inicial em tecnologias efetivamente empregadas pela comunidade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dessa forma, essas listas funcionam como garantia de que nossa primeira mineração não deixe de capturar as ferramentas e práticas mais consolidadas, ao mesmo tempo em que preparam o terreno para, em etapas subsequentes, descobrir termos inéditos de forma automática."
